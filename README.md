This end-to-end project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal was to build a reliable model that can help in early detection based on clinical data.

🫀 Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression Excited to share my latest machine learning project where I built a predictive model to classify heart disease risk using clinical data. This end-to-end pipeline covers: 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🧹 Outlier treatment with IQR-based clipping 🔍 Feature correlations and visual insights via heatmaps 🤖 Model building with Logistic Regression 🛠️ Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV 📈 Achieved 90% accuracy on test data with strong precision and recall metrics This project reflects my ability to translate healthcare data into actionable insights through rigorous data preprocessing, statistical validation, and thoughtful model optimization. #DataScience #MachineLearning #LogisticRegression #HealthcareAnalytics #Python #EDA #HeartDisease #AI #GridSearchCV #PredictiveModeling
